# Drag-Drop
Simple Drag and Drop application

In order to serve up the json file and images to the client, I used a simple
server application HTTP-Server.

Install HTTP-Server globally with:
`npm install http-server -g`

Then run the command:
`npm start`

Navigate to <http://localhost:8080> in your browser and enjoy!
